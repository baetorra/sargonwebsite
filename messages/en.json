      "Sargon is not a brand. It is a vision. A way of experiencing the sea that has nothing to do with luxury for display, but everything to do with authenticity, slowness, and respect.",
      "Born from the intuition of Studio Marine, a strategic laboratory that designs experiences rooted in territory and meaning, Sargon takes its name from an ancient king, not of conquest, but of connection. A name that evokes journeys, encounters, dialogue between cultures and seas.",
      "On board Sargon, there are no fixed itineraries. There are no standardized menus. There is only space: for silence, for listening, for presence. The catamaran becomes a place where the sea teaches you to slow down, where luxury is not what you see, but what you feel."

      "Sargon is the answer to that question applied to the sea. An experience designed to break away from standardization, to rediscover slowness as luxury, and silence as wealth.",
      "The team behind Studio Marine brings together strategic vision, deep knowledge of Sardinian territory, and the ability to translate values into tangible experiences, never imposed, always shared."

      "Behind every detail, from the food prepared at Pentumas restaurant to the wines selected from local wineries, there are people who have chosen quality over quantity, truth over appearance.",
      "Because Sargon is not a service. It is an encounter. And every encounter is made possible by those who believe that true luxury is in authenticity."
